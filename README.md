# **Crypto-Wallet** üöÄ  
*A Secure GUI-Based Cryptocurrency Wallet built with C++ and RAD Studio*  

## **Overview**  
Crypto-Wallet is my first-semester project for **Programming Fundamentals in C++**. This **Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based Cryptocurrency Wallet** is developed using **RAD Studio**, designed to securely store and manage cryptocurrency-related data.  

üîí **Security is a top priority** ‚Äì the wallet uses **password hashing and breach detection** to ensure user credentials are safe.  

---

## **Features**  

### üîë **Create Wallet Page (`createwallet.cpp`)**  
- **Secure Password Storage**: Uses the **djb2 hashing algorithm** to securely hash passwords before saving them.  
- **Breach Detection**:  
  - When a user creates a password, it is checked against a **breached passwords list (`pwd.txt`)**.  
  - If found in the list, the user is **prompted to create a stronger password** (with uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and at least 8 characters long).  
- **Account Creation Security**: Ensures **only strong and unique passwords** are used.  

### üîë **Login Page (`loginpage.cpp`)**  
- **Hashed Password Validation**: Compares hashed user credentials with stored values.  
- **Dynamic Email Storage**: Captures the logged-in user's email for session-based operations.  
- **Automatic Dashboard Redirection**: Upon successful login, the user is directed to the **Dashboard GUI**.  

### üìä **Dashboard GUI (`dashboardpage.cpp`)**  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive design with action buttons for managing the wallet.  

### üìÅ **Wallet File Storage**  
- **Secure File Management**: Each user‚Äôs wallet data is stored securely in a dedicated file.  
- **Storage Location**:  
  ```plaintext
  D:\Crypto Wallet\CLI Proj
  ```
- **File Naming Convention**:  
  ```plaintext
  <logged-in-email>_wallet.txt
  ```
  - This ensures **user-specific wallet storage** for better security and organization.

## **How to Use**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create Wallet**  
   - Enter **email** and **password**.  
   - The password is **checked against breached passwords**.  
   - If safe, it is **hashed using djb2** and stored securely.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Login**  
   - Enter your **email** and **password**.  
   - The password is **hashed and compared** with the stored hash.  
   - Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected to the **Dashboard**.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Dashboard**  
   - Access different **wallet management features** using the available buttons.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Wallet Management**  
   - Your wallet file will be created and stored **securely** in the designated directory.

## **Security Features üîê**  

‚úî **djb2 Hashing Algorithm** ‚Äì A lightweight, **fast hashing function** to store passwords securely.  
‚úî **Breach Detection System** ‚Äì Prevents the use of weak passwords by checking them against `pwd.txt`.  
‚úî **Password Strength Enforcement** ‚Äì Requires **at least 8 characters**, including **uppercase, lowercase, and special characters**.

# Crypto-Wallet
It's my fist semester project of programming fundamentals in C++

This project is a **GUI-based Cryptocurrency Wallet** developed using **RAD Studio**. The wallet allows users to securely store and manage cryptocurrency information with a simple and intuitive interface.

## Features

### Login Page (`loginpage.cpp`)
- **Password Hashing**: Ensures secure storage and validation of user credentials.
- **Dynamic Email Storage**: Captures the logged-in user's email during login and makes it accessible throughout the application by including `LoginPage.h`.
- **Credential Validation**: Checks user credentials against an `accounts` file.
- **Successful Login Transition**: Redirects the user to the **Dashboard GUI** upon successful login.

### Dashboard GUI (`dashboardpage.cpp`)
- A visually interactive interface with multiple action buttons for wallet operations.

### Wallet File Storage
- Wallet files are saved in the directory:
  ```
  D:\Crypto Wallet\CLI Proj
  ```
- The file name format is:
  ```
  <logged-in-email>_wallet.txt
  ```

## Technical Details
- **Language**: C++
- **Framework**: RAD Studio
- **Password Hashing**: Uses a secure algorithm to hash passwords before storage.
- **File Operations**: Reads from and writes to files for credential validation and wallet management.
- **Dynamic Email Handling**: The logged-in email is dynamically passed between forms, ensuring personalized operations.

## How to Use
1. **Login**:
   - Enter your email and password.
   - Credentials are validated against the stored accounts file.
   - On successful login, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.

2. **Dashboard**:
   - Interact with various wallet operations through the provided buttons.

3. **Wallet Management**:
   - Your wallet file will be stored in the specified directory with a unique name based on your email.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for multiple cryptocurrencies.
- Integrate encryption for wallet file storage.
- Develop a backup and restore feature for wallet files.
- Enhance the GUI for better user experience.
